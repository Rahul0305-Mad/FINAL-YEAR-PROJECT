# FINAL-YEAR-PROJECT

The project mainly focuses on modern and traditioanl ways of applying Winnowing Algorithm and GNN for scientific article clustering and classification using winnowing and Graph neural networks. The main dataset used is ARXIV Dataset which is useful for articles and various research papers as well. The advantage of Winnowing compared to others includes para phrasing and various case sensitive alphabets as well. Using this the efficiency and the accuracy of the overall model was built and developed as well.

It also gives the comparision of plagiarism similarity within the ARXIV Documents and the the input that we are providing giving us a more clear idea baout the content visualization in the graph.
